## Branches
* main
    * The main branch has the demo. The shooter and intake run slower. The drive is also slower.
* Orlando-2024
    * The code we ran at the Orlando competition in 2024 except for one change that Lucas made after the competition
    * If you want to revert it to what we ran at competition, change the `goalRPM` in `PickupMotorsSubsystem.java` to 750
